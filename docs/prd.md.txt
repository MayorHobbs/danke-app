## 3. CORE FEATURES

### 3.1 Daily Widget (MVP)

**Home Screen Widget (iOS + Android)**
- Displays 2 elements daily:
  1. **Quote:** Philosophical anchor (15-50 words from Dan's writings)
  2. **Action:** Specific, timeboxed micro-task (5-30 minutes)
- Auto-refreshes at midnight (user's local timezone)
- Tapping widget opens companion app for context

**Lock Screen Widget (iOS 16+, Android 14+)**
- Minimal version: Quote only (space constraints)
- Optional: Just action checkbox

### 3.2 Content System

**Database Structure:**
- 52 weeks of curated quote/action pairs (364 days)
- Categorized by Dan's "Big 3" domains:
  - 🧠 **Consciousness** (philosophy, awareness, belief systems)
  - 💪 **Health** (exercise, nutrition, energy management)
  - 💰 **Wealth** (business, skills, value creation)
  - ❤️ **Relationships** (communication, connection, boundaries)

**Content Rotation Logic:**
- Sequential by default (Day 1 → Day 364, then loops)
- Optional: User selects domain focus (e.g., "prioritize Wealth actions")

**Content Format:**
```json
{
  "day": 1,
  "quote": "Focus is the ability to say no to everything except the one thing that matters most.",
  "quote_source": "The Art of Focus",
  "action": "Write down 3 things you're saying yes to that don't align with your goals. Cross one out.",
  "action_duration": "10 min",
  "domain": "consciousness",
  "difficulty": "beginner"
}
```

### 3.3 Companion App (Minimal)

**Purpose:** Widget configuration + content browsing (not the main experience)

**Screens:**
1. **Onboarding** (first launch)
   - "What area needs most focus?" (Consciousness/Health/Wealth/Relationships)
   - Sets content rotation preference
   
2. **Today Tab** (default)
   - Shows current quote + action (same as widget)
   - "Mark as Complete" checkbox
   - Optional reflection: "What did you learn?" (text input)

   - Filter by domain
   - Tap any day to read quote/action

4. **Settings**
   - Widget refresh time preference
   - Domain priority slider
   - Notification preferences (optional evening reminder)

### 3.4 Evening Reflection (Optional Feature)

**Trigger:** 8 PM local time (configurable)

**Notification:**  
"Did you complete today's action?"

**If Yes:**  
→ "What did you learn?" (1-2 sentence text input)  
→ Saved to local journal (privacy-first)

**If No:**  
→ "What got in the way?" (awareness-building, no shame)
